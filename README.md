## Abstract

### Thesis
Diminishing groundwater levels affecting agriculture productivity

While surface water scarcity is well-documented, New Mexico's agriculture relies heavily on
groundwater from aquifers like the Ogallala and Mesilla Bolson. This resource is being depleted
at an unsustainable rate. This project aims to visualize and quantify groundwater level changes
in a key agricultural region of New Mexico over the last decade. We will use well data from the
Bernalillo County database, which provides periodic measurements of water depth for
thousands of wells across the state. This dataset is ideal because it offers direct, location-
specific evidence of aquifer health. The expected outcome is a Streamlit application featuring a
map of New Mexico where users can select a specific well or region and see a chart of its water
level trend over time. This project will make the problem of aquifer depletion visible, providing a
crucial resource for farmers, water authorities, and communities to understand the long-term
implications on the state's food production and rural economies.
